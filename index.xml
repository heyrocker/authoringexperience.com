      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to the new site authoringexperience.com. On its face, this is a site for my new book Designing Content Authoring Experiences, and I will probably be making some posts about the book, how it came to be, and the process of self-publishing it. However, for some time I have also wanted a place to be putting thoughts about trends in the industry, and thorny problems I&amp;rsquo;m working on. These could be big or small, broad or very focused. Hey I have thoughts about modern page builders! I also have thoughts about what widget to use in select lists for specific use cases and for specific groups of authors! I may also never write another post and this will be all you ever see here. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
