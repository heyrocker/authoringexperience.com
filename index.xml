      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to the new site authoringexperience.com. On its face, this is a site for my new book Designing Content Authoring Experiences. I will probably be making some posts about the book, how it came to be, the process of self-publishing it, and topics related to the CMS space in general. However, for some time I have also wanted a place to be putting thoughts about trends in the industry, thorny problems I&amp;rsquo;m working on, and self-reflections about general topics I care about. These could be big or small, broad or very focused. Hey I have thoughts about modern page builders! I also have thoughts about what widget to use in select lists. I also have thoughts about Survivor and navigating a world that seems bent on beating us down inch by inch, day by day, and year by year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
